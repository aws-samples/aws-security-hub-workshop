# Environment Setup

This workshop's procedures use multiple Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and other AWS resources created via CloudFormation templates. In this module, you will copy the essential contents from the workshop GitHub repository and upload them into an S3 bucket in the AWS account you are using to perform the workshop.

**Agenda**
 
1. Download the workshop assets from GitHub - 5 min
2. Create S3 bucket and store workshop assets â€“ 5 min
3. Determine if have already enabled Security Hub, Config, and GuardDuty - 5 min
4. Deploy workshop CloudFormation stack  - 10 min


## Download the workshop assets from GitHub

1. Navigate to https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-security-hub-workshop/blob/master/deploy/aws-security-hub-workshop-deploy.zip

2. Click **Download** to download the **aws-security-hub-workshop-deploy.zip** file to your local computer in a location that you can easily find.

3. Unzip the file on your local computer.  This will unzip the files to a directory named **deploy**.  

## Create S3 bucket and store workshop assets

1. Navigate to **S3 Console** and click **Create bucket**. 

2. Provide your own **bucket name** and do not adjust the default settings blocking public access.  

!!! info "S3 Bucket name needs to be unique.  You might have to add some additional numbers to the end of your desired name to make it unique."

3. **Record** the bucket name for later use.

4. Click **Create bucket**.

5. Click your **bucket name** to navigate into your bucket.

6. From your local computer, upload the **contents** of the unzipped **/deploy/** directory into the root of your newly created bucket.

!!! info "Do not proceed unless you have five(5) .zip files, five(5) .json files and one(1) .yaml file."

## Determine if you have enabled Security Hub, Config, and GuardDuty.
Config, Security Hub, and GuardDuty must be enabled in the account and region you are conducting this workshop in.  The CloudFormation template that sets up the workshop has the option to enable all of this for you.  If you choose for that to happen, and these services are already enabled, the template will fail.

In order to correctly perform the next step, you must confirm the status of each of these services.  If you already know the status, such as a fresh account provided by AWS for this workshop, proceed to the next section.

1. From the **AWS Console** click **Services** in the top left corner

2. Type **Security Hub** in the services search bar.

3. Select **Security Hub** from the list.

4. If you see  **Go to Security Hub** on the right side of the page, Security Hub is **not** enabled.

5. Click **Services** in the top left corner.

6. Type **GuardDuty** in the search bar, and select **GuardDuty** from the list.

7. If you see **Get started** in the center of the page, GuardDuty is **not** enabled.

8. Click **Services** in the top left corner.

9. Type **Config** in the search bar, and select **Config** from the list.

10. If you see **Get started** in the center of the page, Config is **not** enabled.

## Deploy workshop CloudFormation stack

1. Navigate to **CloudFormation Console**. 

2. Click **Create stack**.

3. In the **Amazon S3 URL**, add the path to your setup template. Replace [YOUR-BUCKET-NAME] in the example below.

```
https://[YOUR-BUCKET-NAME].s3.amazonaws.com/sechub-workshop-setup-template.json

```

4. Click **Next** on Create stack page.

5. Provide your **Stack name**.

6. In the **Parameters** section, select **Yes** (DO ENABLE) or **No** for each of the three services checked in the prior section; GuardDuty, SecurityHub, and Config.  

7. Enter the name of the S3 deployment bucket you created and stored the workshop artifacts in.   Leave remaining parameters with their default value.

12. Click **Next** on Specify stack details page.

13. Click **Next** on Configure stack options page.

14. Scroll to the bottom and **check** both acknowledgments.

15. Click **Create Stack**. 

!!! info "Use the refresh button to see updates as this template will create five nested templates and should take 5-10 minutes to complete.  Once the full stack creation is done you should see findings created in Security Hub over next 30 minutes of this workshop."

In this module, you created an S3 bucket, transferred the workshop artifacts, and deployed the setup templates.  After you have successfully created the stack, you can proceed to the next module.
